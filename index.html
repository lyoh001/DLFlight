                <h2>ABOUT</h2>
                <p>The objective of the study is to analyse the flight booking dataset obtained from “Ease My Trip”
                    website and to conduct various statistical hypothesis tests in order to get meaningful information
                    from it. The 'Linear Regression' statistical algorithm would be used to train the dataset and
                    predict a continuous target variable. 'Easemytrip' is an internet platform for booking flight
                    tickets, and hence a platform that potential passengers use to buy tickets. A thorough study of the
                    data will aid in the discovery of valuable insights that will be of enormous value to passengers.

                    The various features of the cleaned dataset are explained below:
                    1) Airline: The name of the airline company is stored in the airline column. It is a categorical
                    feature having 6 different airlines.
                    2) Flight: Flight stores information regarding the plane's flight code. It is a categorical feature.
                    3) Source City: City from which the flight takes off. It is a categorical feature having 6 unique
                    cities.
                    4) Departure Time: This is a derived categorical feature obtained created by grouping time periods
                    into bins. It stores information about the departure time and have 6 unique time labels.
                    5) Stops: A categorical feature with 3 distinct values that stores the number of stops between the
                    source and destination cities.
                    6) Arrival Time: This is a derived categorical feature created by grouping time intervals into bins.
                    It has six distinct time labels and keeps information about the arrival time.
                    7) Destination City: City where the flight will land. It is a categorical feature having 6 unique
                    cities.
                    8) Class: A categorical feature that contains information on seat class; it has two distinct values:
                    Business and Economy.
                    9) Duration: A continuous feature that displays the overall amount of time it takes to travel
                    between cities in hours.
                    10)Days Left: This is a derived characteristic that is calculated by subtracting the trip date by
                    the booking date.
                    11) Price: Target variable stores information of the ticket price.
